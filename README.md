What is BMI, Ideal Weight, & Body Fat Percentage?
--------------------------------------------------------
BMI means Body Mass Index which measures your bodily mass given your height. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in the units of kg/meter square.
* Body Mass Index (BMI) = Weight (in kg) / Height (in meter square).
Ideal Weight is the approximate weight of your body that produces a healthy and normal BMI.
Body Weight Percentage (BFP) is the approximate percentage of your body that is occupied by fat.

Why it is important to keep track of your BMI?
--------------------------------------------------
In these trying times, what has become the most important thing for us is our health. Most the people are doing WFH (Work-from-home) and that is ultimately affecting their bodies drastically. Some people are getting obese and some are losing weight because of several other health issues like Diabetes. The workforce is losing their health every single day due to which there is a sudden decrease in their productivity levels. I'm trying to serve them with this tool to help them rebuild their immunity and productivity levels.

Age and gender are not in our control. God has given everybody their respective height and weight. Height is a variable that becomes constant after some age. But out of the two, what we can actually control is our weight. Keeping that in mind, tracking your BMI regularly becomes more important. And to do so, my app "BMI Calculator & History" comes to the rescue. Let's talk about this app in detail below.

What do I've to offer?

The first and the most important requirement for any health app is that it needs to be free of cost (or with minimal cost) so that a larger amount of people can benefit from it. There we go, BMI Calculator & History app is completely free-of-cost.

The second most important requirement is that it should be ad-free. The reason is that people who are using this app are seeking self-improvement, focus, mental peace, etc. and continuously running repetitive ads can irritate them and they can lose their path. So, I decided not to earn any monetary benefits from this app by showing ads.

The third important requirement is that it should have a great and clean UI. A clean user interface not only makes the users feel good but also helps them operate the application without any hassle. So, I've spent a lot of time improving the user interface to increase user-friendliness.
Now, let's sum up by writing all the features that my app has to offer.

* Clean UI
  - An ad-free, responsive, user-friendly app with a cool color scheme.
* Accurate results
  - The first priority for such an app is that it should provide accurate results. With proper results, you can gain the trust of
    people. So, I've used WHO-trusted formulae to calculate BMI, Ideal Weight, and Body Fat Percentage.
  - Made sure that there is proper input validation and precise calculation based on the formulae.
  - Have used encouraging messages for the results obtained so that users will get motivated to kick start their BMI tracking journey.
* Awesome history & BMI-tracking chart
  - Many users wish to see the change happening within themselves. To support that, I’ve included history feature with BMI-tracking chart to easily monitor your BMI over the years. Remember, sharing personal health data is not recommended.

NOTE: As all the records are saved locally, removing app’s cache memory or deleting the app can result in loss of data.
